Money Allocation Plan (MAP)
This webapp written in Per/Catalyst is being developed
to serve as a budgetting system based on the book written
by Ethan Pope called "The Money Allocation Plan"

This tool is not just a ledger used to record spending
but it is designed to help one be disciplined in spending
money by prompting the user to determine where the money
will be taken from.

Run script/map_server.pl to test the application.
